          <h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
          <p class="introduction">I am currently an undergraduate of The Oxford college of Science which is affiliated with Bangalore University with a degree in Computer Science and Applications. During my time in college, I held several leadership positions, including the class representative of undergraduate council & proactive member at the Oxford research club associates.
            I am a skilled public speaker and have experience with workshops, event planning, hosting technical & cultural events and fest organizing.
            Computer Science has been driven by a passion for working on projects that have an impact on how people use technology in their daily lives. Being a very curious person, I am always keen on updating my knowledge base to the latest tech stack. Enthusiastic team player, a fast learner with creative problem-solving skills, good coding and communication skills.
            I am eager to use my skills in a larger organization where I can have a greater impact. I am seeking an entry-level position in an esteemed organization. Interested in getting exposure to domains providing intellectually challenging work in the field of computers for proving and enriching my knowledge and skills.</p>
